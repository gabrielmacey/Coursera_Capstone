Severity of accidents will include points such as fatalities, the number of people involved, the type of injuries to the passengers, how many vehicles were involved and a few others. Natural factors including fallen objects, weather conditions such as wind, rain, fog, and snow, and time of day will also be used in finding correlation to the severity of accidents. This is all done with the purpose of being able to let drivers know the possibility and severity of accidents under certain weather conditions."

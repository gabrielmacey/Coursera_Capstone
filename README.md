The notebooks I make through my IBM certificate 
These notebooks analyze accident data taken from the City of Seattle. 
In these notebooks I look at finding correlation between weather and injuries cause by car accidents.
Car accidents have many reasons to their cause and I also look in to some of those,
including light condition, road condition, and being under the influence.
